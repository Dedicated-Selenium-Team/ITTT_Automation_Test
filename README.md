# ittt

The GOAL of ITTT is to:
a) Drive more attention and discussion - down to the individual level - around the hours given for the tasks to be completed during ESTIMATION vs. PLANNING vs. ACTUAL.
b) Drive more attention and effort to the ESTIMATION process. For "new projects" and/or "Additional Requests".
c) Drive more attention and effort to the PLANNING process. Planning: The step that happens POST estimate approval and prior to project commencement. This involves reviewing the estimate and deciding "who will be working on what" and "what hours they have to work against".
d) Drive more attention and discussion around the hours given for the tasks to be completed during ESTIMATION vs. PLANNING vs. ACTUAL.

The DATA from ITTT can drive helpful and useful discussions for everyone, at all levels of the organisation. 

ITTT needs to be Designed/Built in such a way that it takes the LEAST amount of effort (on behalf of the User) to log/submit the required data.
